This is an object oriented molecular dynamics code which makes use of the Lennard Jones potential 
for the interparticle interactions and velocity Verlet Method for the integrator. It was used to 
study a system of Argon initialized in an fcc lattice, but can be easily adapted to other systems.

File organization:
