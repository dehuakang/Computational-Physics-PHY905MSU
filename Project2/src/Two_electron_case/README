The several versions of code here all solve the same problem, but allow for different inputs from the user and output formats.

Version 1: Allows to run the program for 4 different w_r values at once (w_r values are specified within the .cpp file) and outputs all
4 groundstate eigenvectors in a single txt file for easy comparison. This is useful for a quick estimate, but since it uses the same rho_max 
for all w_r, it is not optimal. 

Version 2: Runs for a single w_r value with a user inputed (from command window) rho_max. This allows to experiment with using different
rho_max values.

Version 4: Runs for a single w_r value and finds the optimal rho_max to use automatically. This version is the most optimized code for solving
the problem but it doesn't offer the flexibility to experiment with different values of rho_max.

(Version 3 was identical to  Version 4, but less compactly coded, so it is not included here).
