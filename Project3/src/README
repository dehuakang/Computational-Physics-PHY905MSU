This project simulates the motion of planets in the solar system using the Euler and Velocity Verlet methods. 
Most of the code (everything except parta) is object oriented, making use of two classes: planet and ODEsolver we have written.

File organization:
src contains the C++ code with the codes for the classes in the "classes" folder. 
It also contains matlab code for plotting results from the c++ code output files and for finding perihelion of Mercury.

Benchmarks contains sample output files. 

Report contains the report.
