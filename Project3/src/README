All files ending with _main are object oriented and depend on the two classes (planet and odesolver) located in the classes folder.

Sun-Earth_parta is not object oriented and has no dependencies.

trajectories_plotter.m and energies_plotter.m plot the results from the positions and energies txt files respectively.

mercury_precession.m uses the positions file output from mercury_precession_main.cpp to calculate perihelion precession.
