odesolver.cpp contains the Euler and velocity Verlet differential equation solver algorithms.
planet.cpp defines planet objects and their various properties

odesolver_reduced_output outputs only the last 0.5% (this can be changed easily) of the x,y positions. This was used for Mercury precession
to allow for high time resolution simulation.

odesolver_for_timing does not output anything and is simply for timing the core of the two algorithms.

It is not necessary to change odesolver.h in order to use the different odesolver cpp file versions.
