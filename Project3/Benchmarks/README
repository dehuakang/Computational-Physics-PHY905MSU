Benchmark outputs for various systems studied are included here. 
The file naming scheme used is: [method]_[# of planets]_Planets_[time step in year]_[energies or positions]

The column organization for positions files is as follows:
time  planet_index  mass(w/respect to sun's mass) x_position y_position z_position  x_velocity  y_velocity  z_velocity

The column organization for energies files is:
time  system_kinetic_energy   system_potential_energy   system_total_energy(kinetic+potential)

We were unable to upload to here a benchmark of the Mercury precession due to space limitations. The benchmark result when using 
10 billion integration points for century of Mercuries orbit is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B11aRXgy0zsCYThvbVJCTnN5REU/view?usp=sharing
Note that the file only  contains the last 0.5% of the simulation (~last orbit).
